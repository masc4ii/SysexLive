# SysexLive
A sysex sender for two synths

##What is SysexLive
When playing live with my band, I was always very slow in configuring my synths for the next song. With this tool you just press a shortcut and two synths are configured. You can open and save setlists.

##Used libraries
SysexLive uses darkstyle theme from Copyright (c) 2017, Juergen Skrotzky (https://github.com/Jorgen-VikingGod, JorgenVikingGod@gmail.com) and QMidi (which uses rtMidi).

##Compile
You can compile this app with Qt5.1.1 and later. It runs on macOS 10.6.8 and later (and should also run on Windows and Linux).
