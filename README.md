## What is SysexLive
When playing live with my band, I was always very slow in configuring my synths for the next song. With this tool two or four synths are configured by just press one shortcut via sysex messages via MIDI. Alternatively you can send MIDI program changes for calling the configuration for all your synths (thanks to @rockumk). You can open and save setlists.

## Used libraries
SysexLive uses darkstyle theme from Copyright (c) 2017, Juergen Skrotzky (https://github.com/Jorgen-VikingGod, JorgenVikingGod@gmail.com) and QMidi (which uses rtMidi).

## Compile
You can compile this app with Qt5.1.1 and later. It runs on macOS 10.6.8 and later (and should also run on Windows and Linux).
